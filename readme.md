Why I want to contribute to open source?
Contributing to open source projects will allow me to collaborate with developers from around the world, fostering teamwork and help in developing essential collaboration skills.

Open source communities often have experienced contributors who are willing to mentor and guide us. We have a great opportunity to learn.

Contributing to open source allows us to showcase our work and contributions, which can greatly enhance our portfolio and increase chances of getting noticed by potential employers.
